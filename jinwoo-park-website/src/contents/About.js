            Welcome to my website! I'm an undergraduate computer science student at Georgia Tech interested in expanding his programming horizons through various personal projects. 
            Whether it be through developing an Alexa skills at HackGT to recite the dining menu at my school or challenging myself to create a card game app in under a month, 
            I am excited to jump into new tasks and am determined to follow through on my aspirations.
